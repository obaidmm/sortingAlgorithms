In this lab, for question 1, we will write all the sorting methods we discussed in the class in their generic form (except for Bucket-sort) and check their execution time for an Integer type dataset. 

For question 2 we will create a StudentGrade type class, and then after populating a list with certain number of students and their corresponding grades, we will sort that list based on last name, or first name or the grade.
